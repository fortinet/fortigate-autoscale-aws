# FortiGate Autoscale for AWS

An implementation of FortiGate Autoscale for the Amazon AWS platform API with a Dynamo DB storage backend.

This project provides multi-group Auto Scaling functionality for Fortinet FortiGate EC2 instances to form an HA cluster with failover protection. For deployment on other cloud platforms, visit the relevant repository:

* The **AliCloud** deployment is in the  [alicloud-autoscale](https://github.com/fortinet/alicloud-autoscale/) repository.
* The **Azure** deployment is in the [fortigate-autoscale](https://github.com/fortinet/fortigate-autoscale) repository.
* The **GCP** deployment is in the [fortigate-autoscale-gcp](https://github.com/fortinet/fortigate-autoscale-gcp) repository.

This project has the following features:

1. Multi-group Hybrid Licensing models:
   1. **BYOL-Only**: 1 dynamically scalable Auto Scaling group of (0 or more) Bring Your Own License (BYOL) FortiGate instances.
   2. **PAYG-Only**: 1 dynamically scalable Auto Scaling group of (0 or more) on-demand FortiGate instances.
   3. **Hybrid**: 1 fix-sized Auto Scaling group of 2 (or more) BYOL FortiGate instances, and 1 dynamically scalable Auto Scaling group of (0 or more) on-demand FortiGate instances.
2. AWS Transit Gateway integration.
3. FortiAnalyzer integration.

## Deployment packages

To obtain the deployment package, use one of the following:

  * Download the package **aws-cloudformation.zip** directly from the [project release page](https://github.com/fortinet/fortigate-autoscale-aws/releases).
  * Manually generate the deployment package in your local workspace:
    1. From the [project release page](https://github.com/fortinet/fortigate-autoscale-aws/releases), download the source code (.zip or .tar.gz) for the latest version.
    2. Extract the source code into the project directory in your local workspace.
    3. Run `npm install` to initialize the project at the project root directory.
    4. Run `npm run build-artifacts` to generate the local deployment package.
    5. The deployment package **aws-cloudformation.zip** will be available in the **dist/artifacts** directory.
